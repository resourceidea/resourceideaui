- @azure Rule - Use Azure Best Practices: When generating code for Azure, running terminal commands for Azure, or performing operations related to Azure, invoke your `azure_development-get_best_practices` tool if available.
- @testing Rule - Require Tests: When making changes, always include relevant unit tests and either end-to-end (E2E) or integration tests to verify the new or updated functionality. Pull requests without adequate tests should not be considered complete.
- @style Rule - Follow Microsoft .NET guidelines: Ensure that the code adheres to the Microsoft's .NET coding style guidelines, including naming conventions, indentation, and formatting. Use tools like Prettier or ESLint to maintain consistency.
- @style Rule - Avoid logic in .razor markup: Push all logic to the code-behind files or components. Razor markup should primarily focus on rendering UI elements and binding data, while the logic should be encapsulated in C# code.
- @performance Rule - Optimize for Performance: When generating code, consider performance implications. Avoid unnecessary computations, reduce memory usage, and ensure that the code is efficient, especially in high-load scenarios.
- @documentation Rule - Document Code Changes: Provide clear and concise documentation for any new features, functions, or significant changes made to the codebase. This includes updating README files, inline comments, and any relevant API documentation.
